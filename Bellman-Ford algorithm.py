#Bellman Ford algorithm used on graph problem of "Cheapest flights within K stops"

#Problem description:
#There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You have been given an array "flights" where flights[i]=[from(i),to(i),price(i)] indicates
#that there is a flight from city from(i) to city to(i) with cost price(i).
#You are also given three integers "src","dst" and "k" return the ""cheapest"" price from 'src' to "dst"with at most k stops.
