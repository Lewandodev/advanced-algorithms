#Advanced qucik sort is combination of 2 algorithms: quick sort and insertion sort
#combination of qucik and insertion sort will create very efficient algorithm regardless of the size of input
#with the time complexity of O(n^2)
#(as insertion sort is better for small arrays and qucik sort for large arrays)



#Algorithm will consist of auxiliary fucntions (qucik sort and insertion sort) and the main advanced sort algorithm
#the main idea of the algorithm will be recursively checking the size of input array and deciding whether we will use qucik sort or insertion sort
